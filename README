This is a small project that models n-player (n = 1-100) bingo games and keeps track of how many turns (numbers called) are required before there is a winner for a game of bingo. Each n-player bingo game is run 1000 times, and the number of turns before a win is outputted for each game, allowing calculations for the average number of turns it takes for a winner in a game of bingo comprising n players.
